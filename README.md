# Person, teacher and student classes
This project was created to practice the learned concepts about classes in JavaScript.

## Description
The `class Person` is a model to create objects with the following attributes: _firstName_, _lastName_, _age_, _gender_ and _interests_.
<br>
The `class Teacher` and the `class Student` BOTH extend the aforementioned person class. But the `class Teacher` has one more attribute (_subject_) and a different greeting method, and the `class student` only differs by the greeting method.
